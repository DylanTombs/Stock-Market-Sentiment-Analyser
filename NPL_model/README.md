# NLP Model 
**Goal**: Build and fine-tune LLMs for financial sentiment analysis.  

### Tasks    
- **Model Training**: Fine-tune a pretrained model (e.g., `BERT`, `FinBERT`) on financial text.  
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Implement a scoring system (e.g., -1 to +1) for bullish/bearish signals.  

### Deliverables  
1. A trained model (save as `.pkl` probably).  
2. Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score vs. manual labels).
